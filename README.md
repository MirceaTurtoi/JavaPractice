# Practice for Java
Repository to practice java. There are multiple packages in source code file detailed below.

## AbstractClasses
In this package i built a LinkedList using interfaces and abstration. I also traversed the list using binary search with a recursive method.

## ArrayLists
In this package i practiced ArrayList and Inner Class by building a playlist creator. Initially i stored the songs from an album using ArrayList and then i used an Inner Class to create objects that contains a list of songs.

## BillsBurger
Here i built a burger factory to practice inheritance and constructors.

## Interfaces
In this package i've implemented an interface that requires Player class and Monster class (or any other class that implements this interface) to write and read data.
